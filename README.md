This project provide detail analysis about financial health of the bank with respect to different types of Loans.

**Objective:**

This comprehensive Bank Loan Report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help to make data-driven decisions, track the loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

****DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY****

Summary Dashboard aim to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' This report will serve as a valuable tool for analysing and understanding the key indicators associated with different loan statuses. By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.

**KPIs for the Dashboard Analysis:**
  - Total Loan Applications: 
  - Total number of loan applications received during a specified period.
  - Total Funded Amount:
  - Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment.
  - Average Interest Rate: Average interest rate across all types of loans
  - Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health.

    **MTD (month-to-date) is a period that starts at the beginning of the current month to the current date.
  MoM (month-over-month) is a metric that reflects growth. It is the smallest measurement of growth for a business that shows the increase or decrease in this month’s value of a certain variable as a percentage of the previous month.**

    _**(All the KPIs are calculated in MoM and MTD basis.)**_

**Good Loan & Bad Loan KPI’s**

_**Bad Loan: Loans with a loan status of 'Charged Off.'**_
